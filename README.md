# CNN---A-Large-Scale-dataset-for-Fish-Classification
Jupyter Notebook for 1st homework of the KNowledge Discovery course at UniCT

## Description

A deep model that consists of 2 Convolutional Layers, to extract and recog-nize increasingly complex features, followed by 2 Fully Connected Layers and a Classifierto perform multiclass classification (see Fig. 1).  Initially, input data flows trough the con-volutional layers, to exploit image information.  Then the extracted features are providedto the fully connected layers and to the classifier, which predicts the class outcome amongone of the 9 possible classes.

## Usage

Upload the dataset provided on your Google Drive.
Load the .ipynb notebook on Google Colaboratory, and you will be able to run the cells.
