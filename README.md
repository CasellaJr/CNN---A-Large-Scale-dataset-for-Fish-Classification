# CNN---A-Large-Scale-dataset-for-Fish-Classification
Jupyter Notebook for 1st homework of the KNowledge Discovery course at UniCT

## Description

A deep model that consists of 2 Convolutional Layers, to extract and recognize increasingly complex features, followed by 2 Fully Connected Layers and a Classifier to perform multiclass classification (see Fig. 1).  Initially, input data flows trough the convolutional layers, to exploit image information. Then the extracted features are provided to the fully connected layers and to the classifier, which predicts the class outcome among one of the 9 possible classes.
